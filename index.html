    <p></p>Essay on Mahatma Gandhi – Mahatma Gandhi was a great patriotic Indian, if not the greatest. He was a man of an unbelievably great personality. He certainly does not need anyone like me praising him. Furthermore, his efforts for Indian independence are unparalleled. Most noteworthy, there would have been a significant delay in independence without him. Consequently, the British because of his pressure left India in 1947. In this essay on Mahatma Gandhi, we will see his contribution and legacy.

Essay on Mahatma Gandhi

Contributions of Mahatma Gandhi
First of all, Mahatma Gandhi was a notable public figure. His role in social and political reform was instrumental. Above all, he rid the society of these social evils. Hence, many oppressed people felt great relief because of his efforts. Gandhi became a famous international figure because of these efforts. Furthermore, he became the topic of discussion in many international media outlets.

Mahatma Gandhi made significant contributions to environmental sustainability. Most noteworthy, he said that each person should consume according to his needs. The main question that he raised was “How much should a person consume?”. Gandhi certainly put forward this question.

Furthermore, this model of sustainability by Gandhi holds huge relevance in current India. This is because currently, India has a very high population. There has been the promotion of renewable energy and small-scale irrigation systems. This was due to Gandhiji’s campaigns against excessive industrial development.

Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence is probably his most important contribution. This philosophy of non-violence is known as Ahimsa. Most noteworthy, Gandhiji’s aim was to seek independence without violence. He decided to quit the Non-cooperation movement after the Chauri-Chaura incident. This was due to the violence at the Chauri Chaura incident. Consequently, many became upset at this decision. However, Gandhi was relentless in his philosophy of Ahimsa.

Secularism is yet another contribution of Gandhi. His belief was that no religion should have a monopoly on the truth. Mahatma Gandhi certainly encouraged friendship between different religions.

Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi has influenced many international leaders around the world. His struggle certainly became an inspiration for leaders. Such leaders are Martin Luther King Jr., James Beve, and James Lawson. Furthermore, Gandhi influenced Nelson Mandela for his freedom struggle. Also, Lanza del Vasto came to India to live with Gandhi.


The United Nations has greatly honored Mahatma Gandhi. UN has made 2nd October as “the International Day of Nonviolence.” Furthermore, many countries observe 30th January as School Day of Nonviolence and Peace.

The awards given to Mahatma Gandhi are too many to discuss. Probably only a few nations remain which have not awarded Mahatma Gandhi.

In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the greatest political icons ever. Most noteworthy, Indians revere by describing him as the “father of the nation”. His name will certainly remain immortal for all generations   </p>

  <h1>3.Jawaharlal Nehru</h1>
  <hr />
  <img src="jawa.jpeg" alt="" />
  <p>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of Independent India was also the architect of modern India. He was born great and also achieved greatness by his vision, hard labour, sincerity, honesty, patriotism and great intellectual powers. He virtually died in harness. He never wasted even a single moment.


ADVERTISEMENTS:


 
It was he who gave us the slogan, “Aram Haram Hai.” tie was always full of optimism, vitality, vigour, enthusiasm and activity. He was a leader of the masses and beloved to them. Their deep love and respect for him always enthused, inspired and sustained him. The good of the masses was ever at his heart. He had undertaken many projects for the welfare of them and the prosperity of the country. He set up the National Planning Commission with himself as its first Chairman.

Jawaharlal Nehru Two years later he created a bigger National Development Council. His aim was to improve the standard of living of the people, to better their quality of life. Under him the first Five Year Plan was launched in 1951. He very carefully prepared the road-map of India’s industrialisation.

Nehru made relentless attack on poverty, ignorance, backwardness and superstitions. He underlined the importance of “scientific temper”, and did his best to cultivate and spread it. He was a staunch socialist and believed in equality, freedom and brotherhood.

His concern for the untouchables, the weaker sections of the society and the right of women was uppermost. The launch of the “Panchayati Raj” system throughout the country was another great step in the right direction. He was so popular that he became India and India was Nehru.

ADVERTISEMENTS:


 
He was a great nationalist and patriot but he never lost sight of internationalism and the world peace. He propagated the “Panch Sheel” for international peace and harmony and made India an important country among the developing countries of the world.

His love for children was limitless. He liked to talk and play with them. He regarded them the real wealth and golden future of India. He looked into their innocent and smiling eyes and felt assured about country’s future.

Children’s Day is celebrated on 14th November every year because it is his birthday, and the children proudly called him “Chacha Nehru”. This bond of love, affection and understanding was deep and abiding. In a session of the Indian National Congress he said charged with noble sentiments and patriotic feelings, “I have hardly any ambition left, but there is one ambition left in me. I should throw myself with all the strength and energy left in me into the work of building up India.

I want to give it my utmost, till I am exhausted and thrown away on the scrap- heap. It is enough for me that I have exhausted my strength and energy in India’s task. I do not care what happens to reputation after I am gone. But if people choose to think of me then, I should like them to say, “This was the man, who with all his mind and heart loved India and the Indian people. And they, in turn, were indulgent to give hint their love most abundantly and extra-vagrantly”.




 
Nehru was a great democrat and a pacifist. He always followed the principles of democracy, peace, harmony and co­existence. He believed in “live and let live”. He hated violence, exploitation and ignorance. He was a visionary, idealist and dreamer and yet a very practical man. His contribution to the world peace and cooperation has been very significant.

He supported the UN wholeheartedly and gave the world the non-alignment movement and leadership to the third world countries. He had declared very categorically that the sole aim of the movement was, “Peace and Peace. We aim and pray for peace. Peace can only come when nations are free and also when human beings everywhere have freedom and security and opportunity”.

Really he was India’s “man of destiny”. He became a living legend and a thousand names. His charismatic personality, wisdom and love for the people inspired confidence, hope and enthusiasm in millions and millions of India. He was a great writer besides a great politician and diplomat. He was an idealist, mystic, dreamer, scientist, author, orator, planner, realist and internationalist, all rolled into one.

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was born to Motilal Nehru and Swarup Rani Nehru in Allahabad on November 14, 1889. Nehrus then lived in Anand Bhawan (abode of joy). Motilal Nehru himself was born posthumously in 1861 in Agra and was brought up by his uncle Nandlal an advocate. Motilal was an eminent lawyer of Allahabad and had moved to this city as the Provincial High Court was shifted here from Agra. Swarup Rani was his second wife. He had lost his first wife along with a son born to her. He again lost his first son from Swarup Rani, Thus, Jawaharlal was his second son.




 
Originally Nehrus were Kashmiri Brahman Pandits and were known as Kauls. The ancestors of Nehrus had migrated to the plains in search of greener pastures and better fortunes. One of the Nehru’s ancestors Raj Kaul was a noted member of the Delhi Court during Farruksiar’s reign.

He had a large jagir on the bank of a “nahar” or canal, and so came to be known as Kaul-Nehru. Nehru is a corrupted form of the world “nahar” (canal). Gradually, the term “Kaul” got dropped and they were simply known as Nehrus. Nehru’s grandfather Gangadhar was Kotwal of Delhi. During the first war of Independence in 1857, he had moved to Agra from Delhi to escape the carnage let loose by the British troops but died three months before Nehru’s father Motilal was born.

Nehru was sent to England for his education. In 1912 he returned to India and came into close contact with many national leaders. He was very much influenced by the ideology and clean and non-violent political practices of Mahatma Gandhi.

He joined the freedom struggle under Mahatma’s leadership. He was elected Congress President for the first time in 1929 at its Lahore session and then again in 1930 at Karachi session. He subsequently occupied this position in 1936, 1937,1946,1951,1953 and 1954. As a President of the Congress Nehru lent dynamism, proper direction and orientation. He was also one of the most prominent members of the constituent Assembly.


Nehru was next to Gandhi in the political hierarchy and importance. He was very popular among the masses. Moreover, there was a marked subtlety and expertise in his relation with the party and its various big leaders. Brilliant, catholic, erudite, charismatic and passionate nationalist, soon he become Gandhi’s political heir.

Sardar Patel was much senior to him, but because of these qualities, he was chosen to be the first Prime Minister of India in 1947. On the occasion of the first independence day of midnight of 14/15 August of 1947 he said, delivering his so famous speech, “Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially.


 
At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India awakes to life and freedom, a moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.

It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the larger cause of humanity”. But soon the trauma of partition and later the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi plunged the whole country into abysmal gloom, dejection and darkness. And then Nehru said, “The light has gone out of our lives and there is darkness everywhere … the father of the nation is no more … the best prayer that we can offer him and his memory is to dedicate ourselves to truth and to the cause tor which this great countryman of our lived and for which he died.” The tragedy shook the country to its very foundations.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

Nehru shone like the sun on the political horizon for about a century. He won the hearts and minds of the people by his utmost sincerity, patriotism, vision and sense of service to the masses. His dedication to the cause of India was strong and firm. He spent the best part of his life and youth in prisons. But the blatant betrayal by China in 1962 was too great a shock for him. He never recovered from this shock and finally died on May 27, 1964.

The Chinese had annexed a large part of Indian Territory around Aksai Chin where India and China had a common boundary, and then they invaded India’s north­western border. In the wake of the Chinese attack he suffered a stroke in January 1964 during the party session at Bhubaneswar and again in May which proved fatal.

Nehru’s death and final departure left the country stunned and shattered for a long time. His last words, “I have disposed of all my files” sums up his whole philosophy and attitude to work and duty. His love and liking of Robert Frost’s poem “Stopping by woods on a Snowy Evening” was immense because it expressed his own sentiments so beautifully.

He always kept it written on a piece of paper and under the glass of his working table. It was there when he breathed his last. Some lines of the poem run like this: “The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.”

Establishment of Azad Hind Fauj
He supposed that non-violence movement is not adequate to arrive at freedom from the British rule so he chose the opposite; the violence movement to fetch freedom in the nation. He went away to Germany and then to Japan where he made his very own Indian National armed forces, also known as the Azad Hind Fauj. He had incorporated some Indian prisoners of war as well as some Indian inhabitants of those countries in his Azad Hind Fauj to battle courageously against the British rule. He gave catchphrase or a slogan to his army named ‘Delhi Chalo’ and ‘Jai Hind’. He had motivated his army men through his splendid words of “Give me blood and I will give you freedom” to make the land of his birth free from the law of the Britishers.

Demise of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
It is well thought-out that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose passed away in an air plane crash in the year 1945. According to the erudite opinion, the actual reason of his death was because of the third-degree burns due to the filled to its capacity Japanese plane crash.

The shocking news of the loss of such a great soul had wrecked all the hopes of his Indian National Army to struggle against the British rule. Even after his demise, he is still breathing with his vibrant patriotism in the heart of each and every citizen of India as an everlasting and never ending inspiration. The great works and assistance of Netaji have been marked in the history of India and are etched in the minds of each and every member who are born in this country.</p>

Sear's History of the World, Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, and The Dictoinaries of Sciences.

	Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.  In October of 1879 Edison patented his incandescent lamp.  Edison and his team made a new vacuum pump to make better vacuums in glass light bulbs.  It was better known as the "glow bulb."  Thomas' second attempt at the glow bulb successfully lit for forty hours.  On New Year's Eve Edison lit up Menlo

Park with thirty glow bulbs.  Electricity would replace gas for lighting purposes.  The light bulb gives off light so that we can see with out lanterns and candles.  The Edison Lamp Company produced 1,000 lightbulbs a day.

In 1925, lamps were given an inside frosting that had a fine spray of hydrofluoric acid.  In the late 19th century, florescent lamps were invented.  Theyare tubes filled with low-pressure neon gas.

Essay about River Ganga
Long Essay on River Ganga 500 Words in English
Known to be a sacred river, the river Ganga has a religious background in Hindu Mythology. According to ancient texts, King Bhagirath had ancestors who had committed huge sins. To cleanse his kingdom of the burden of their bad deeds, he meditated to bring Goddess Ganga to life. It was said that by bathing it in people could wash away their sins and attain salvation. However, the massive force of the river Ganga would have destroyed the earth, so Lord Shiva matted her onto his hair and she flowed from it in streams. Since goddess Ganga is known for liberating people from the cycle of life and death, people immerse the ashes of their loved ones in this holy river.

The river Ganga is formed by the union of two main tributaries known as Bhagirathi and Alaknanda at the place called Devprayag. The point where the river Bhagirathi and Alaknanda meet at Devprayag we call it the river Ganga. Bhagirathi originates from the Himalayan glacier Gangotri while Alaknanda rises from Nanda Devi, the northern peak of the Himalayas. Though Alaknanda and Bhagirathi are its two main tributaries, the Ganga also has three others that rise from the Himalayas, namely Mandakini, Dhauliganga, and Pindar. It is said that Ganga originally rose from Gaumukh, which is to the southeast of Gangotri.

Further, while flowing through the Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, it has several tributaries like the river Yamuna, Gomti, Kose, Sone, and Ghagra which is the largest one. The river Ganga meets the river Yamuna and the river Saraswati (the dead river) at the point called Triveni Sangam in Allahabad. After passing Devprayag, the river Ganga continues its journey towards Uttarakhand, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and lastly West Bengal. The river Ganga enters Bangladesh where it is joined by the river Mahananda, where it is called the Padma. The large delta of the river Ganga is in Bengal which is shared with river Brahmaputra (which lies mostly in Bangladesh).

It is essential to know that since the river Ganga flows through densely populated and fertile areas of the Northern Subcontinent of India, it provides livelihood to billions of people. Further, there are many birds who rely on it for their habitat. The river Ganga is home to more than 140 species of fishes and 90 species of amphibians. That is the reason why it is heartbreaking to see this sacred river marred with the burden of human and industrial waste.

The river Ganga is the second most polluted river in the world. In order to cleanse it, the Ganga Action Plan was formulated in 1986 which failed epically. However, the Namami Gange program is an ongoing cleaning initiative that has been successful in cleaning the water. The river Ganga has been threatened by pollution for decades now and it is crucial that we work diligently to prevent it from being damaged all the more. If we succeed in saving the river, we would succeed in saving many lives and eradicating other means of pollution too. </p>

  <h1>7.Yamuna - River</h1>
  <img src="yamuna.jpeg" alt="" />
  <p>      Yamuna River is India’s fifth longest river. Over the past several centuries, the river has been the important part of culture in India. It has been the major source of daily bread and butter for millions of Indians. In pursuit of spiritual significance, Yamuna has been venerated with great hope for many. Currently, the river is more in the headlines for being the most polluted river in India for all bad reasons.


 
The source of Yamuna River is frozen Champasar Lake in Banderpooch Glacier located at the altitude of 6387m in Har-Ki-Doon hilly ranges of Uttarkashi located in Uttarakhand. It runs through widest range of forested and snow-capped valleys in Himalayas before getting into the Indo-Gangetic North Indian plains. After flowing for 1376km, the river merges into the Ganges in Allahabad.

Sacred Places Located along Yamuna River

Yamuna River is believed to be originated from Yamunotri Shrine. It is listed as one of the four major pilgrimage places or Char Dhaam in Uttarakhand. It greets thousands of pilgrims from different parts of the world every year.

Yamunotri is known to be the first shrine to be visited on this pilgrimage site. Whole Valley of Yamuna River is loaded with several sacred shrines as well as mythological sites that are devoted to legends and saints of ancient era. River Yamuna is among the most popular rivers in North India. It is around 1370km long.


 
Yamuna River is also called as River Jamuna. Yamuna River flows in south way along the Himalayan Mountains on the plains of North India, and it traverses through a lot of valleys for around 200km along the border of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

Yamuna River traverses along various states like Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, before it merges in Allahabad with River Ganga. Cities like Mathura and Agra are located along its banks. Yamuna River is believed to be originated at Yamunotri in Himalayan regions of Uttarakhand, positioned at the north of Haridwar located at the altitude of around 6387m over the sea level.

Cities like Noida, Mathura, Allahabad, Hamirpur, Delhi, Baghpat, Kalpi, Etawah, and Agra are located on its banks. The source of Yamuna River, Yamunotri also forms the Goddess Yamuna seat. It is supposed to be one of the four Char Dhaam sites in India.

Yamuna River witnesses very light traffic. It shrinks in Agra as a very small stream in summer, partly due to the amount of water removed for domestic consumption and irrigation by the canals.

However, the river has been one of the most polluted rivers in India. Most of its course passes through very densely populated locations where most number of sewages has been discharged on it. With financial support from Japan in the early 1990s, the Indian government has started Yamuna Action Plan, which is a multi phase project to reduce the pollution levels of the river. Passing from Delhi, Yamuna River feeds the Agra Canal. It passes Agra, Etawah, and Firozabad. It receives a lot of southern tributaries below Etawah.

Bhatia was the son of a government worker in a country in which acting often runs in the family. As a young man, he trained extensively in dance and martial arts, and his first movie role, nonspeaking and uncredited, was as a martial arts instructor in Aaj (1987; Today). He worked at a Bangkok food stall, tried his hand at modeling, and appeared in several films before being offered a starring role in Deedar (1992; “Glimpse”) by director Pramod Chakravarthy. It was in those early stages of his career that he took the professional name Akshay Kumar.

Kumar acted in a steady stream of thrillers and fast-paced dramas, including Khiladi (1992; “Player”), which brought him considerable attention. His athleticism and daredevil nature were well displayed in action films such as Main khiladi tu anari (1994; I’m the Expert, You’re the Novice), in which Kumar played a police inspector protecting a star witness. He again portrayed a conflicted policeman in Mohra (“Pawn”), one of the most popular Indian films of 1994. Despite his success in those high-intensity roles, Kumar’s good looks also led him to star in romantic comedies such as Yeh dillagi (1994; The Game of Love), a loose adaptation of the American film Sabrina, and Dhadkan (2000; “Heartbeat”), a story of arranged marriage in which Kumar’s character must win over his reluctant bride. Ajnabee (2001; “Stranger”) was a change of pace for the usually charming actor, and his turn as a philandering husband and murderer won him his first Filmfare Award, for best villain.


With Hera pheri (2000; “Monkey Business”), the versatile actor again took on a new kind of role—that of the comedic lead. Hera pheri was a remake of the Indian film Ramji Rao Speaking (1989), a kidnapping caper, and it was popular enough to lead to a sequel (2006). Kumar continued to appear in comedies, and Garam masala (2005; “Hot Spice”) garnered him a second Filmfare Award, for best actor in a comedic role. His later films included Heyy Babyy (2007), Singh Is Kinng (2008), OMG: Oh My God! (2012), Toilet: Ek prem katha (2017; “Toilet: A Love Story”), 2.0 (2018), Good Newwz (2019), and Laxmii (2020). He also starred in the popular Housefull series of comedy films (2010, 2012, 2016, and 2019).
